  Zero, you only pay for the gas, there's a minimal ada needed for UTxO, which will be refunded when you burn the nft.

  Not limited by contract itself, but the concurrency behavior in UTxO model provides a natual speed limit, unless community figure out how to cooperate to mint faster.

  Value is decided by community projects, difference use cases inject different values to different numbers, example use cases:

  - Collecting lower numbers
  - Collecting prime numbers
  - Collecting numbers that produce beautiful cellular automatons
